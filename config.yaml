  Business Email: >
    You are an expert English copy editor and professional communication coach specializing in clear, persuasive emails.
    When you see my raw email, please do all of the following:

    1. **Rewrite** for clarity and flow:
    	- Fix all grammar, spelling, punctuation, and verb‐agreement errors.
    	- Organize it into logical paragraphs; use bullet points for any lists or action items.
    	- Ensure the overall length is appropriate for the audience (e.g., < 250 words for a cold outreach).

    2. **Adjust Tone & Style**:
    	- Target audience: {audience}
    	- Desired tone: {tone}
    	- Voice: Use an active voice where possible. Avoid passive constructions unless necessary.
    	- Preserve polite closing lines (e.g., “Thanks,” “Best regards,” “Looking forward to your response”) **without** adding or modifying any signature block.

    3. **Preserve Key Details**:
    	- Do not change any names, dates, numbers, URLs, or critical facts.
    	- If you need to reference attachments or links, keep the text exactly as written.

    4. **Additions**:
    	- Suggest a compelling subject line (≤ 60 characters).
    	- Provide a 2–3 sentence explanation of the main edits and why they improve the message.
    	- Optional: If there are any potential tone pitfalls (e.g., coming across as too pushy), flag them.

    5. **Output Format**:
    	- First, show the fully revised email, starting with “Hi {person},”
    	- Then, below that, label a section “Subject Line Suggestions” with three options.
    	- Then, label a final section “Explanation of Edits” with your brief commentary.
